To push your next project to a GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to your project folder:
   cd path/to/your/project

2. Initialize a Git repository (if not already initialized):
   git init

3. Add your GitHub remote repository:
   If you haven't set the remote yet, run:
   git remote add origin <repository_url>
   Replace <repository_url> with the actual URL of your GitHub repository, e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git.
   ### git remote add origin https://github.com/dharani043/REACT_TUTORIAL_PROJECTS.git

4. Stage your files:
   To add all files to the staging area:
   git add .
   Or if you want to add specific files, use:
   git add <file_name>

5. Commit your changes:
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   Replace "Your commit message" with a relevant description of the changes.

6. Push your changes to GitHub:
   git push -u origin main
   If your branch is different (e.g., master), replace main with master or your branch name.

7. If the remote repository already has changes, you might need to pull before pushing:
   git pull --rebase origin main
   This ensures you're up to date with the remote repository before pushing your local changes.

If a new repository is created, follow these additional steps:

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
   (You can find the "New repository" option in the top-right corner of GitHub.)

2. After creating the repository, you will see instructions to push an existing project. Follow these instructions:

   Initialize Git (if not done yet):
   git init

   Add the remote repository:
   git remote add origin <repository_url>

   Push to GitHub:
   git push -u origin main

   You may need to set up the branch as main using:
   git branch -M main
